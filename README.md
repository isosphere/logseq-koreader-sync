# Logseq Koreader Sync
<h3 align="center">A koreader to logseq syncing plugin.</h3>

This is a tool to import your annotations from KOReader in a read-only format - this is a one directional synchronization[^1]. The pages generated by this plugin are intended to be read-only. However, they are intended to be freely referenced elsewhere in your graph in a way that does not mind the pages being regenerated (i.e.: blocks are assigned UUIDs that persist). 

As of this writing, it is working. However, if it is run twice you will duplicate all annotations in Logseq with new blocks. Consistent block UUIDs and avoiding this duplication is an important next step for this plugin.

[^1]: perhaps one day we can do bidirectional synchronization, but that sounds like a very difficult task right now. 

## üöÄ Features
- [x] Import annotations from a [KOReader](https://koreader.rocks/) metadata folder containing "*.sdr" folders with `metadata.*.lua` files.
- [ ] Reference blocks imported by the sync using UUIDs that persist despite future synchornization attempts

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation
