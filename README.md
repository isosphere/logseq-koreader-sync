# Logseq Koreader Sync
<h3 align="center">A koreader to logseq syncing plugin.</h3>

As of this writing, it has just been created; it's not usable yet.

This is a tool to import your annotations from KOReader in a read-only format - this is a one directional synchronization[^1]. The pages generated by this plugin are intended to be read-only. However, they are intended to be freely referenced elsewhere in your graph in a way that does not mind the pages being regenerated (i.e.: blocks are assigned UUIDs that persist). 

[^1]: perhaps one day we can do bidirectional synchronization, but that sounds like a very difficult task right now. 

## 🚀 Features
- [ ] Import annotations from a [KOReader](https://koreader.rocks/) metadata folder containing "*.sdr" folders with `metadata.*.lua` files.
- [ ] Reference blocks imported by the sync using UUIDs that persist despite future synchornization attempts

## 🛠️ Installation

TBD
